## About Me

- My name is **Duy Tran**, a **Pentester & Security Researcher** based in Vietnam.  
- I specialize in **Red Team operations, vulnerability assessment, and adversary simulation**, with a growing interest in **Blue Team methodologies** and **detection engineering**.  
- I enjoy **breaking systems** to understand them deeply — and then **helping teams defend better** through actionable insights.  
- My current focus includes **offensive tool development**, **OSINT automation**, and **attack surface mapping**.  
- I believe a good attacker should also understand defense — because knowing how detection works makes your attack smarter.
